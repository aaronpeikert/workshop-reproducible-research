# Basic Idea

## Task

* the IMDB (Internet Movie Database)

* we make a explorative data analysis via graphs
* everyone contribute and we work as a group

* title - title of the movie.
* year - Year of release.
* budget - Total budget (if known) in US dollars
* length - Length in minutes.
* rating - Average IMDB user rating.
* votes - Number of IMDB users who rated this movie.
* r1-10 - Multiplying by ten gives percentile (to nearest 10%) of users who rated this movie a 1.
* mpaa - MPAA rating.
